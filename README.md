## Description
I created a project management application. I may able to keep track of due dates and progress. I utilized jQuery UI to make the application more interactive and user-friendly.
<!-- -   Designed an index and blog page.
-   Created a form to input data and implement it on the blog page.
-   Implemented a toggle switch for light or dark mode.
-   Added a back button to add more input to create more blog posts.

Also, I learned how to implement Javascript work with localStorage and how to structure more complex directories with multiple folders and files. --> -->

CODE SOURCE NOTE: I worked with a tutor on this assignment.
